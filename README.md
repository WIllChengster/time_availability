This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Time Availability prototype

This app is time scheduler. I wanted to create an app that keeps track of people's weekly availability.
When I worked in entry level jobs, I was always asked about my weekly availability by my managers so I figured I'd start a scheduling concept app.

To run this app, run:

### `npm install`
 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
